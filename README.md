# Q & A
## Why did you make this?
I was really bored and I dropped I project like this before, so I thought hey, why don't I remake it, but a little better and in TypeScript.

## What type of problems did you run into while making this?
The biggest thing I learned is that React state management definately isn't enough for any large scale projects, even this midsized project was already a drag just because of how many props I had to pass to each component.

Another problem I ran into while making this is that my knowledge on cleanup wasn't enough before, so for instance when I didn't do cleanup in my useEffect for sending messages it kept emitting messages and adding them to the state so after about 5 messages it started massively lagging.

Lastly, doing the styling by yourself for each component can make it hard to track whether it's responsive or not and makes it hard to change later on when each styling can affect another. Some of the styling is also not cross browser compatible.

## Did you learn a lot?
Yes, definately. I have learned a lot more about React especially on how to run it with TypeScript and how to handle useEffects and the cleanup in them.
I also learned a little about how to setup a simple NodeJS Express and SocketIO server, which I must say is definately a lot less intimidating than it sounds.
